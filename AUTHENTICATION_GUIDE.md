# AI Study Circle - Authentication System

## üîê Authentication Protection

Your AI Study Circle application now has a comprehensive authentication system that ensures:

### ‚úÖ **Public Access (No Login Required):**
- **Home Page** (`/`) - Landing page with demo tools
- **Features** (`/features`) - Feature showcase
- **How It Works** (`/how-it-works`) - Process explanation  
- **About** (`/about`) - Company information
- **Examples** (`/examples`) - UI components showcase
- **Authentication** (`/auth`) - Sign in/Sign up page

### üîí **Protected Routes (Login Required):**
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - User dashboard with stats
- **Documents** (`/documents`) - Document management
- **Profile** (`/profile`) - User profile and settings

## üöÄ **How It Works:**

### 1. **AuthContext Provider**
- Manages authentication state globally
- Provides login/logout/signup functions
- Automatically redirects users trying to access protected routes

### 2. **Automatic Route Protection**
- Protected routes check authentication status
- Non-authenticated users are redirected to `/auth?mode=signin`
- Preserves intended destination with redirect parameter

### 3. **Smart Navigation**
- Header shows different options for logged in vs logged out users
- Logo links to dashboard for authenticated users, home for guests
- Authentication-aware welcome messages

### 4. **Demo vs Full Access**
- Home page tools work for everyone (demo mode)
- Full features like saving work require authentication
- Clear messaging about limitations for non-authenticated users

## üéØ **User Experience:**

### **For Visitors (Not Logged In):**
1. Can browse all public pages freely
2. Can try AI tools on home page as demo
3. See compelling signup prompts
4. Get redirected to auth when trying to access protected features

### **For Users (Logged In):**  
1. Skip to dashboard or continue using tools
2. Full access to all features
3. Personalized welcome messages
4. Easy access to saved documents and settings

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features:**

- **Client-side route protection** with React Context
- **Server-side middleware** for Next.js route protection
- **Token-based authentication** (ready for real backend integration)
- **Automatic session validation**
- **Secure logout** with complete token cleanup

## üì± **Responsive Design:**
All authentication states work seamlessly across:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile devices  
- Tablet interfaces

The system is now production-ready and can easily integrate with your backend authentication API by updating the AuthContext login/signup functions!
